## Lectures

Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays. I will post a .pdf of the lectures from each class. Attendance is not required. 

A helpful addition resource are [Dr. Leemis's 451 Lecture Videos](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/videos/probability/) corresponding to the suggested text book.

## Text

Suggested text: 

[Leemis, L.M., Probability, Second Edition, 2018, Lightning Source.](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Lawrence-M-Leemis/dp/0982917473)

More information on the book can be found on Dr. Leemis' webpage ([link](https://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/)) along with answers to selected exercises ([link](https://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/ptext.sol2.pdf)).

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person in my office Jones 125 at the times posted above. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email.

## Weekly Quiz Problems (QPs)

Most weeks I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following week either Tues or Thurs at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 15% of your final grade. The lowest QP grade will be dropped. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers. 

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 a zero will be entered for the grade. By droppping the lowest grade, missing one won't hurt your grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP. 

## Suggested Problems (SPs), Book Problems (BPs), and Reading

To supplement lecture and the QPs, I will also post

1. a PDF of suggested problems and solutions (on blackboard)
2. problems from the suggested book, along with solutions (on blackboard)
3. readings from the suggested book 

## Midterms

There will be two in-persons midterms during normal lecture times. They will be at the dates in the table above (in class). The midterms will account for 25% of the grade each. 

## Final

The final exam will be as scheduled by the registrar (see above). The exam will be comprehensive. It counts for 35% of the final grade.

### Mental and Physical Well Being

William & Mary recognizes that students have many different responsibilities and can face challenges that make learning difficult.  There are many resources available at W&M to help students. Asking for help is a sign of courage and strength.  Please reach out to me if you or someone you know are facing problems inside or outside the classroom, and I will do my best to guide you to appropriate resources on campus.   Those resources include: 

- For psychological/emotional stress, there is the W&M Counseling Center (757-221-362), 240 Gooch Dr. 2nd floor, [(https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/counselingcenter/)](https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/counselingcenter/). Services are free and confidential.

the heart of the university, and we all are responsible for upholding the ideals of honor
and integrity.” Please remind yourself of your responsibilities by reading the Student

Recordings may not be reproduced, shared with those not in the class, or uploaded to other online environments; violations may be subject to disciplinary action.
